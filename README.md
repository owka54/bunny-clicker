Bunny clicker - An idle / clicker game

The aim of the game is to click a carrot on the screen to collect carrots. Then with these carrots you buy items which will earn you carrots without having to do anything!

You can also buy upgrades to earn carrots even faster. For example... you can upgrade the number of carrots you get with each click, or increase the number of carrots an item earns for you.

There is a special bunny that flies across the screen every so often on a carrot rocket. If you click this bunny, you will earn either 1000 carrots or 100x your carrots per second. (Will add more bonuses in the future)
